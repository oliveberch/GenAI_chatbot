"query" : Signing up for paperless billing 
"response" : When you sign up for paperless billing the benefits include: 
1. Cost savings: Save your organization time and resources rather than having staff take time to open, scan, file, and shred paper invoices. 
2. Secure: Protect yourself. Many hands touch paper invoices on their journey through the postal system. Instead of taking chances, review your invoice online. 
3. Convenient: Set up email alerts so you know when your invoice is ready to be downloaded. 
4. Continuity: Continue to pay invoices with the same payment method you've been using
