issue : Updating your web browser
resolution : If you're having trouble getting Control Center to load quickly, your account information to show, and struggling to get the system to do what you expect it should do, your web browser could be the cause of all the frustration. 
To access Control Center, Brightspeed supports the following browsers: 
1.Chrome version 45 and higher (Mac and Windows) 
2.Firefox version 43 and higher (Mac and Windows)
3.Edge version 15 and higher (Windows only) 
To begin fixing the problem, figure out which browser you're using, and then, decide if you need to update the version you're on, change to a different type of browser, or clear the cache of your browser. Also, if you're wondering which browser you're using (including the version), it's easy to automatically check it.

issue : Clearing your browser cache, cookies, and history
resolution : If you're experiencing glitches when you work in Control Center, the solution might be as simple as clearing your browser cache, cookies, and history. 
Your browser lets your computer talk with the internet to serve up web pages. To do its job, it must "remember" certain things. For example, instead of wasting time reloading the same images or even entire web pages, over and over again, your browser will save some of this information for faster downloading times. And, depending on your computer settings, it may also remember addresses of websites you've visited, documents you've downloaded, your search history, commonly used passwords, and data from advertisers. 
Sometimes all that history can cause problems. If you're repeatedly experiencing trouble loading a web page, a first troubleshooting step is to clear your browser cache, cookies, and history. This forces your browser to look for fresh information and stop loading old data.

issue : Troubleshooting login problems where Problems with login credentials
resolution : If you've forgotten your login credentials, you can retrieve your username and password. (If needed, as part of the retrieval process, you can reset your password.) 
If you're certain the username and password are correct, the problem might be how you're entering the information. 
Browser or network 
Are you copying and pasting your username or password? If so, that could be why you're experiencing troubles. When a username and password is copied, extra spaces may be included and 
inserted as part of the login credentials. With the extra space, the system doesn't recognize the username or password, and you get an error message. If this is the problem you're 
experiencing, manually typing in your username and password should solve it. 
Are you relying on your browser to enter your password using stored information? Stored passwords usually don't work with our systems. We recommend manually typing in your Control Center password, rather than relying on your browser to retrieve it. 
For some customers, the system automatically 
adds @control.brightspeed.com to the end of their username. For example, if your username is sallysmith, the system would change it to be sallysmith@control.brightspeed.com. If you see this happen with your username, do not delete the @control.brightspeed.com. It's there for a reason and is part of the login process. 
Note: If you're ever asked to provide your username, type the information before the @ sign-in this case, sallysmith.

issue : Troubleshooting login problems where Problems with a deactivated user profile
resolution : If it's been a while since you last signed in, your Control Center user profile may be deactivated. For security purposes, Control Center deactivates user profiles after six months of inactivity and emails you 30 days before to remind you that your profile will be deactivated. (You can keep your profile active if you sign in every six months.) If your user profile is deactivated, your system administrator can reactivate your user profile for you so you can sign in again. 
}

{
issue : Troubleshooting login problems where Problems with a locked user profile 
resolution : After several unsuccessful login attempts, Control Center locks your user profile for security purposes. This is a preventative measure against unauthorized people accessing Control Center with your credentials. If your user profile is locked, you'll receive an email with instructions on how to proceed. 
}

{
issue : Troubleshooting login problems where Problems with your browser or network 
resolution : If your login credentials are correct, the problem could be with your browser. If Control Center is running slowly, that could be a browser problem, try the following: 
clear your browser cache, history, and cookies 
try using a different type of browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) update the browser version you're using 
If none of these things work, close your browser and restart it. 
Sometimes login problems have to do with your IP address. For instance, if you work for a government agency and have tried the things mentioned in this article without success, you should consult your IT department. The problem may be that your computer was temporarily disconnected from your network. Resetting, or renewing, your static IP address could solve the problem.
